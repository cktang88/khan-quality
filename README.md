# Khan-Quality

An app to find videos that need attention in Khan Academy.

## Motivation

When using Khan Academy one day, I found several videos had low resolution, suboptimal sound quality, or many similar critical comments in "Tips & Thanks" that were unanswered. This correlated with videos that needed updating. I decided to make this to hopefully find all such videos automatically and highlight them.

Note: I highly admire Khan Academy, and this app is made to be helpful, not critical.
